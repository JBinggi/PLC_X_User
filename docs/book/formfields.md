# User Form Fields

All form fields are user based. So within User Manager, you can what fields
each and every user can see. Have the most fine grained control over your data
you could ever imagine!

Why User based form fields? Well and more and more countries, handling personal data is a serious
task you should not take too easy. So with that option, you will be able to show sensitive fields
of lets say your Contacts like Email, Name, only to those users that really need that information.

Also you can have internal fields for only a certain group of users this way.

## Manage Fields

All fields can be managed in User Manager. Just select a user, edit and set the fields you want.
New fields will automatically be added to User Manager.
